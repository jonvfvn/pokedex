# Pokédex ⚡️ 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scenario 💻 
- Display the contents of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json in a user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing manner
- Design and code a React.js application to display the remote data in a tabular format, using any additional libraries
- Each record in the table needs to contain the ‘num’, ‘name’ and ‘type’ properties and display the associated image.
- The table data is ordered alphabetically on the ‘name’ property, in ascending order
- When a user clicks on a table row, the application provides them with additional information on the selected entry
- Search functionality

## Available Scripts 📝
